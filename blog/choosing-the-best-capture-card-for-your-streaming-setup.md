When it comes to game streaming, choosing the right capture card can make all the difference. **Capture cards** allow you to record and stream gameplay from consoles or PCs, providing high-quality content for your audience. Here are some key factors to consider:

### Compatibility
Make sure the capture card is compatible with your gaming setup. Check if it supports the specific consoles (PS5, Xbox) or PC systems you use.

### Resolution and Frame Rate
Look for capture cards that support at least 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second (fps). For those who want to stream in higher quality, models like the **Elgato HD60 X** offer up to 4K60 HDR10 passthrough.
