### Introduction
Streaming audio problems can be frustrating, especially for new streamers. This guide will help you diagnose common issues like echo, background noise, and microphone distortion.

### Common Audio Problems and Solutions
1. **Echo**  
   - Check your microphone placement. Ensure itâ€™s not too close to your speakers.
   - Use headphones to prevent sound feedback.
   
2. **Background Noise**  
   - Invest in a good microphone like the [![Logitech G Yeti GX Dynamic RGB Gaming Microphone](https://www.gamestreamingsetup.com/logitech-g-yeti-gx.jpg)](https://amzn.to/446et4B) that rejects background noise.
   - Use noise gates in your streaming software to cut out unwanted sounds.
