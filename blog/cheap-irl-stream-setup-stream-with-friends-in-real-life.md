## Streaming in IRL from working out to exploring the world to chatting and beyond!

Live streaming is not just about playing video games - it has a host of other applications. They enjoy going to the gym and are even into meditation or just hanging out with friends or going on a walk in town. There are many different niches available. For example, there is outdoor streaming when someone is hiking or exploring nature and action sports like skiing and mountain biking. Or you could livestream at home by exercising, chatting, or doing something that isnâ€™t video games.

## Here are our recommendations for a cheap IRL streaming setup

### Use your Smartphone!

That smartphone in your pocket is perfect to start off with and probably the easiest for you start off with. Get a good quality monopod or [selfie stick](https://amzn.to/3ek1wx0) and you'll be set to go on adventures and livestreaming in no time.

We recommended this [adjustable telescoping bluetooth selfie stick](https://amzn.to/3ek1wx0)  on Amazon that is cheap and has a bunch of features.

### GoPro Hero 8

The [GoPro HERO8](https://amzn.to/3edFL1S)  is a couple generations behind but not for the features it's way cheaper than the current generation and still just as good. The GoPro HERO8 is an easy and convenient way to get the footage you want. With its video stabilization, you'll be able to capture smooth and steady shots without having to deal with the shakiness of handholding a camera or mounting it on something unsteady. You can easily capture 4k video footage and live streaming footage at 1080p. It also has a rugged case that is waterproof for those adventurous moments. It's also great for regular vlogging on the go as there are plenty of official and third-party accessories to choose from such as chest mounts, monopods and much more.

### Rode Lav + Microphone

The GoPro microphone audio is not ideal and for quality audio you'll want to get something more professional. The Rode lav plus microphone is a inexpensive premium audio recorder that is perfect for vloggers on the go. The audio quality is excellent and it's small enough to fit into a pocket, purse or backpack. It has a standard tripod mount and can be mounted to any camera that accepts an external microphone input.

### Lighting
Having great lighting while you're streaming on the go or at home is important since your video quality is what keeps people watching. We love these Neewer 2-Pack Dimmable 5600K USB LED Video Lights because they are super cheap, come in a two-pack, have adjustable stands, and even different color filters. You can easily throw these in bag and use them with a portable charger on the go or set up them up on your desk.

### Phone Lens

If you're using your phone, we highly recommended getting a clip-on lens to increase your field of view and give you a more professional look for your stream. The [Xenvo Pro Lens Kit](https://amzn.to/3rEXe6F) is our pick as it works with any smart phone and comes with a macro and wide angle lens for any situation.
