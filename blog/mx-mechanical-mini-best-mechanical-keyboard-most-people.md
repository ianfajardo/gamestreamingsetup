## Why You Should Consider Buying the MX-Mini Mechanical Keyboard

The MX-mini Mechanical Keyboard is a great keyboard for gamers and typists alike. The lack of a number pad, small size, and slim profile are all very appealing to many consumers. The MX-mini has a sleek design that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional.

## Why use a mechanical keyboard? 

A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard that uses switches to register key presses. These switches provide tactile and audio feedback when they are activated, which provides users with instant physical feedback. They offer a typing experience that is unmatched by traditional rubber-dome and membrane keyboards, which use a single sheet to form the body of the key.

Mechanical keyboards offer a wide array of benefits. They last much longer than traditional keyboards, can be customized to fit your needs and are typically more affordable than their membrane counterparts. With these advantages, it's hard to find a reason not to use one.
