## Best Graphics Card for Streaming on Twitch

Graphics cards (aka GPUs) are the most important piece of hardware you need to stream on Twitch. They handle all of the on-screen graphics and video output, so a good graphics card will allow you to play games as well as stream them in high quality without any lag or choppy frame rates.

The GPU processes all these data in order to maintain high-quality video streaming. A poor-quality GPU or a bottleneck can make your streaming experience less than satisfactory as it will result in laggy, choppy or blurry footage.

In this article, we take a look at what features you should look for when purchasing a graphics card for your gaming setup and how it can help you achieve high quality visuals when doing live streaming on Twitch

## How to Choose the Best Graphics Card for Streaming on Twitch

When it comes to choosing the best graphics card for streaming on Twitch, there are a few things to consider. Some of the most important considerations are your budget, what games you want to stream and what type of streaming you want to do.

### AMD RX 6700XT

The AMD RX 6700 XT graphics card is an excellent choice for gamers who want to play and stream their games at 1080p without a hiccup. It has a 3rd Gen FinFET 14nm process, which means it is more efficient and capable of delivering the performance that gamers need.

It features 8GB of high-bandwidth GDDR5 memory, which is a huge amount to handle all your in-game settings and textures. With help from the 6th Gen AMD "Polaris" architecture, this graphics card is much more capable than its predecessor â€“ it has 16 Compute Units (780 Stream Processors), and twice as many pixels on the screen at once.
