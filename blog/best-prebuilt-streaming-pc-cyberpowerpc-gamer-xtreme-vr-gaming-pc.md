## Why Choose a Prebuilt Gaming PC over Building One Yourself?
If you are looking for the best gaming PC, there are a few things to consider before you buy one. One of these considerations is whether or not you want to build your own PC. If you're someone who prefers building PCs yourself and has time on your hands, then building one yourself may be the best option for you. However, if time is of the essence and money is a factor, then you may want to consider buying a pre-built gaming PC. 

A gaming PC can cost anywhere from about $200 to $4,000. However, the average price is about $1,000. If you are looking for an affordable gaming PC that doesn't have very high specs and will provide good performance for playing video games, then you should expect to pay around $300-$400. If you are looking for a higher-end gaming PC that will play a variety of games with better graphics and more features, you should expect to pay around $1000. Through our thorough research, the [CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC](https://amzn.to/3CvooTz) on Amazon is one of the best deals out here.

**Specs**:
- Intel Core i5-11400F 2.6GHz 6-Core
- Intel B560 Chipset
- 8GB DDR4 RAM
- 500GB PCI-E NVMe SSD
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB Video Card
- VR Ready with HTC VIVE and Oculus Rift
- Genuine Windows 11 Home 64-bit
- Included keyboard and mouse

The PC has great performance with the CPU scoring 3900~ points on Cinebench R20, and 9969 points on Cinebench R23 through our testing. It can handle mostly any game you throw it at it and with the performance can handle video game streaming very well. 

The case itself, even without any modifications from the user, has enough vents in the case to provide adequate airflow. The included NVME is super speedy and will future-proof your setup. Though you may need to add an additional hard drive if you plan on collecting a bunch of games. It is also setup to be VR ready with HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift. The only downside is that it comes with the stock CPU cooler so you may need to pick up an upgraded cooler eventually. However, it is relatively inexpensive for that upgrade compared to others. The PC also comes with a keyboard and mouse as well for a full setup. It's a good plus even if you have your own keyboard and mouse since it doesn't hurt to have a spare or two in storage.

The [CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR  Gaming PC](https://amzn.to/3CvooTz) is often on sale for around $800-$900 which is a steal with the combination of parts. At the time of writing, it is on sale for $879 down from $1014. We definitely recommend picking it up on sale if possible but even with the MSRP price tag it's a great deal with the combination of parts and the time you'll save building your own if you're trying to get into gaming and streaming right away.
