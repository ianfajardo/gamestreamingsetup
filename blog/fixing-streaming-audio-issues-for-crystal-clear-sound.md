## Understanding Common Audio Problems
Streaming audio issues can be frustrating, but identifying and fixing them is essential for a professional sound. Here are some common problems and solutions:

### 1. Echo and Reverb
- **Cause**: This usually happens when your microphone picks up sound from your speakers.
- **Solution**: Use headphones to prevent sound leakage. Adjust microphone sensitivity and positioning.

### 2. Background Noise
- **Cause**: External noise can disrupt your stream, especially in noisy environments.
- **Solution**: Consider using a dynamic microphone like the [Logitech G Yeti GX Dynamic RGB Gaming Microphone](https://amzn.to/446et4B) that rejects background noise effectively.

### 3. Microphone Distortion
- **Cause**: This can occur if the gain is set too high.
- **Solution**: Use the gain control on your microphone to adjust sensitivity, and ensure you’re not too close to the mic.
