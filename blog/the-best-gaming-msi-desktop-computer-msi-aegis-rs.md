During our testing, the i7 version of the PC ran super cool and played almost all games on max settings 1080p with no issues. .Another thing that impressed us is that while it’s designed for gaming, the system ran relatively quiet. If you're really into liquid cooling, the i9 is the version to get with it's built-in 120mm Dragon CPU liquid cooler to keep your games running smooth on high settings and especially in 4k.

## Conclusion & Final Thoughts on the MSI Aegis RX Gaming Desktop Computer

The i5 version is a great bang for your buck and has a solid set of specifications that will play most games perfectly on normal to high settings with some tweaks. You definitely have a lot of room in the case to play around with upgrades in the future as well. The RTX 30 series GPUs are still very hard to come by and very worth it already. If these computers are in your price range for building a computer, then this might be better to start off with just for the graphics card.
