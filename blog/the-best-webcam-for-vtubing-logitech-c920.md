## What are Virtual YouTubers, or VTubers?

Virtual YouTubers or VTubers are famous for their life-like avatars that can communicate with others in the virtual world. The avatar looks like a person and can be made to look like its own person or the user. They are also able to interact with other avatars in the virtual world. The rise of the internet and social media has created a digital era. Connecting to each other has never been easier and with a digital footprint, it is easy to track your information. VTubers are an alternative to this digital era, allowing you to keep your identity private by controlling what you share about yourself .The virtual world gives users the ability to design their own lives and control their identities. This allows them to create a unique experience for every user that allows them to not feel limited by the physical world. VTubers give people the freedom of expression through video games, music, art, and technology while they are able to maintain privacy in their identity. Through their webcams, they are able to still express their emotions through their avatar.

## The Best Webcam for Vtubing: Logitech C920

The first thing you need to get to start your career as a VTuber is a high-quality webcam. At its core, a VTuber is a video blogger who creates and uploads videos on YouTube. For the best quality, you need to have a high-quality webcam for your videos. Although your actual face isn't getting recorded, the better webcam you get, the better the system will be able to capture your facial expressions.

The Logitech C920 is a high-quality webcam that is designed for video conferencing. It has an excellent microphone, and it records in 1080p. It has a wide field of view and it can capture the whole room with its lens. The Logitech C920 is also one of the most affordable webcams on the market today. This webcam will also be better than your built-in, low-quality webcam on your laptop if you are using one. If you are using a laptop, we definitely recommend getting a more powerful desktop so that your system can handle your VTubing software, like VRoid Studio, and streaming software.

When it comes to webcam lighting, we would highly recommend you get a ring light. They can be used with most computers and cameras and will aid in giving your video a high-quality look. A ring light is a circular light source that can be attached to the camera or set directly underneath it, lending a soft glow and enhanced contrast. Because of the circular nature of the beam, you will have more even lighting all over your subject. Ring lights are effective for many things: A tool for makeup artists, hair stylists, and photographers to be able to see their subjects from different angles. This can help avoid shadows, wrinkles, or other flaws. Increased production value because of the even lighting over your subject and better quality video output.
