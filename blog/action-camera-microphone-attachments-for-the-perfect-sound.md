## How to Choose the Right Action Camera Microphone Attachments For Your Needs

Choosing the right mic for your action camera is a crucial decision. The camera's microphone is what records sound and dialogue, so it's important to make sure you have the best possible quality. A good mic for an action camera should be able to withstand heavy use, be durable, and produce high-quality sound.

Action camera mics are designed to be mounted on or near the camera. This is because they are meant to record audio of a particular event. They are often used in sports like surfing, skiing, and motocross racing, but they can also be used in other situations like recording an interview or capturing sound effects for a film.

For these reasons, it is important that action camera mics have some features that make them stand out from each other. They should have a good noise reduction rating and be able to capture sound at different ranges so that it can pick up sounds from far away as well as close-up sounds.

A microphone attached to the GoPro can also come with additional features that are not present on the camera. These features include recording levels and audio control settings.

## 5 Tips to Get the Best Audio from Your Action Camera Microphone Attachments

1. The first tip is to make sure that the camera is on a flat surface. This is important because if the camera is on an uneven surface, it will produce an uneven sound.

2. The second tip is to make sure that the mic isn't too close or too far from the subject of your video. If it's too close, then there will be a lot of noise and distortion in your audio recording, and if it's too far away, then you won't be able to hear what they are saying clearly enough.

3. The third tip is to make sure that you have enough lighting in the room or area where you're filming so that there isn't any noise from ambient light sources like street lights or lamps in your audio recording as well as so that you can see your subject and themselves clearly.

4. The fourth tip is to make sure that you have the camera angle that you want before you start filming so that there's no time for second thoughts about what's happening in the video, literally.

5. The fifth tip is to maintain eye contact with your subject at all times throughout the filming process so that they know they are being filmed.
