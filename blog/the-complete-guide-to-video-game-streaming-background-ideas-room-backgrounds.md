## The Benefits of Having a Good Background Room Setup for video game streaming

Video game streaming has been a popular form of entertainment for gamers and non-gamers alike. The popularity of video game streaming has grown exponentially in the last few years. This is because it provides a way for people to do something they love and make money at the same time. However, there are some challenges that come with this type of work, especially when it comes to background setup and lighting.

This section will discuss the benefits of having a good background room setup for video game streaming. It will also talk about how to set up your background room, what equipment you'll need, as well as how to use them properly.

## Setting Up Your Streaming Background

The most important thing you need to do is set up your background room. This can be anything from a simple white wall to a full-on gallery with art and lighting. The key is that the background room should have enough contrast in color and light so that it's easy for people to make out what the streamer is doing. 

### Clear Up a Workspace

When starting off streaming, you may not want to spend a lot of cash right at the beginning. Your first step is to make sure you choose a room where you’ll have space to have your streaming desk setup. If you want to have a green screen or a backdrop, make sure you have enough space for it. When starting off,  just a simple white wall as your background is more than good enough.

1. Create a space where the camera can capture your face clearly and show your reactions to whatever is happening on screen
2. Make sure that the background room has enough light so that viewers can see what's going on in the room
3. Keep it clean - avoid clothes, food wrappers, and other clutter from being visible on screen at all times
4. Consider adding some decorations that speak to your personality or interests

### A Streaming Backdrop

If having a clear white wall is just not an option, the best thing you can do is get a backdrop. We recommend purchasing [a black backdrop and stand](https://amzn.to/3RCecNB) as a starter. It comes with a stand and a simple black cloth backdrop. If you need any additional colors, you can always purchase another since you already have a stand and switch them out as necessary. Another option is to get a green screen and then digitally replace the background in your live stream. Some streamers even put their gaming streams in the background so just the outline of yourself is showing in the corner.

### Lighting

The next thing you want to invest in is lighting, very often, you’ll be streaming in the afternoons and lighting won’t be great. Seeing yourself on your webcam is a huge part of live streaming nowadays. Your viewers are what make live streaming an enjoyable experience and they come because they want to see YOU. With an inferior setup and light, many viewers may shy away from your stream because they’re unable to see anything. We recommend in investing in a great desk light that will illuminate your room and face. The [Logitech Litra](https://amzn.to/3UZbftl) is sturdy and great for people just starting out with streaming. This light will allow you a clear view of what you're doing without any distractions.

### Personality

Having a simple background is great to start off with. But if your stream is about a specific theme or if you want to spice it up a little, you'll want to show some of your personality in your background. One way to do this is by adding some imagery that relates to your stream's theme. For example, if you're streaming a bunch of games, you could put game consoles and controllers in the background or put icons of popular games-- like Pacman-- around you. If your stream is more personal, then something quirky or funny can go well with it. Neon signs in the background make for an easy and cool way to add some flair to your background. You might need to play with the placement so it doesn't ruin your regular lighting, but there are plenty of [options like this](https://amzn.to/3yaEhMP) online to choose from.

Backgrounds are an important part of a video game stream. They can be used to create a sense of immersion and to set the mood for the game being played. The background room setup is what makes or breaks a high-quality video game stream.
