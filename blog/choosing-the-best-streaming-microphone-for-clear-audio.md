When it comes to creating high-quality streams, selecting the right microphone is crucial. This guide will help you understand the differences between USB and XLR microphones, ensuring you make an informed choice for your gaming setup.

### USB vs. XLR Microphones
- **USB Microphones:**  
  - Plug-and-play convenience  
  - Ideal for beginners  
  - Generally more affordable  
  - Example: [![Logitech G Yeti GX Dynamic RGB Gaming Microphone](https://www.gamestreamingsetup.com/logitech-g-yeti-gx.jpg)](https://amzn.to/446et4B)

- **XLR Microphones:**  
  - Offer better sound quality  
  - Require an audio interface or mixer  
  - More control over audio settings  

### Recommendations
For those just starting, a USB microphone like the Logitech G Yeti GX is a strong choice, offering high-quality sound and ease of use. For advanced streamers, consider investing in an XLR setup for enhanced audio control.

### Tips for Optimizing Sound Quality
- Position your microphone correctly  
- Use pop filters to reduce plosives
