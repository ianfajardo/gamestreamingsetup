## Get Great Audio for Your Stream

Having great quality audio for your voice when streaming is one of the most important things to get right when starting off. No one wants to listen to low-quality audio where it sounds like you're in the bottom of the ocean.

### Blue Yeti Nano USB Microphone

This is an exceptional USB condensor microphone that is virtually plug and play with both Windows and Mac. It has excellent audio quality featuring two sound patterns, cardioid and omnidirectional. The original Blue Yeti microphone featured two more patterns but for video game streaming, you'll probably always keep it in the cardioid pattern. We love the nano because it's virtually the same price as the original Blue Yeti but in a smaller, sleeker form factor. Streamers have been using Blue Yeti microphones for years now and for good reason.

Features:
- Professional-level recording and streaming audio
- Multiple pickup patterns: Cardioid and omni pickup patterns
- No-latency monitoring
- Compact footprint
- Plug 'n play with Mac or PC
