## Amazon now offering a sign-up option for the Playstation 5

Amazon has a new invitation option to purchase the new console which is currently out of stock due to high demand. Since this is the first time there’s been an official announcement, they are limiting purchases in order to ensure that they can accommodate all the orders that come in on launch day. However, there’s still hope if you sign up for a notification email.

Amazon states, "If invited to purchase, you'll get an email with a link that's valid for 72 hours. We won’t be able to grant all requests."

## Many fans still searching for a PS5

Getting a console is near impossible because bots are snatching them up as soon as they're available. This new system should reduce the number of bots that repurchase and resell your inventory. It's clear that demand for video game consoles is at an all-time high. With so many consoles available on the market, it would be easy to assume that there isn't a shortage in supply. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. The reason for the scarcity has to do with resellers who use bots to snatch up as many units as they can when they're available and then resell them through eBay for profit.

As the world recovers from the pandemic and people are able to return to their normal lives, some unlucky gamers are finding out just how difficult it can be to find a PlayStation 5 console. Sony has been in the process of producing these consoles for years now, but with recent shortages and delays due to the pandemic, they're becoming even more difficult to find. Fans have taken to websites like eBay and Craigslist to find deals.

With the new Amazon sign-up system, hopefully you'll get your chance to pick a Playstation 5 up.
